## Use Camera Toggle

The `useCameraToggle` hook allows us to toggle through a list of camera options using the reserved camera attribute.

The hook will return an array of two items. The first is the camera attributes data, which includes the options available and selected. This list can be filtered by providing a list of allowed cameras as a property in the hook's config object - `{ cameras: ['Camera 1', 'Camera 2']}`.

The second item is the step change handler where calling the function will update the camera to the next one in the list, looping around if its at the end.

```jsx
import { useCameraToggle } from 'threekit/hooks';

const Component = () => {
  const [cameraAttribute, handleCameraSelect] = useCameraToggle();

  return (
    <div>
      {cameraAttribute.values.map(el => (
        <button onClick={() => handleCameraSelect(el.value)}>{el.labe}</button>}
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```
