## Use Langauges

The `useLanguages` hook allows us to select and update the language we want our Threekit sourced data (i.e the configurator) to be displayed in.

The hook returns an array that includes, respectively, the selected language, an array of language options (strings) and a change handler for updating the language.

It is used to build the [LanguageSelector Widget](#language-selector)

**Note: The languages have to be defined and populated in your org on the Threekit Platform.**

```jsx
import { useLanguages } from 'threekit/hooks';

const LanguageSelector = () => {
  const [selected, options, handleChange] = useLanguages();
  return <div>// Any custom component to use languages</div>;
};
```
